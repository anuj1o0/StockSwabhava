## Problem Statement

Investing can be an overwhelming and confusing endeavor for many people. With countless options and strategies, it is difficult for the average person to make informed investing decisions. Many people do not invest at all or make poor choices due to lack of guidance.

### Proposed Solution

InvestorSvaabhav uses a questionnaire to assess the user's investment personality and risk tolerance. Based on their responses, users are categorized into investing "personas" that determine the investing guidance they will receive.

Each persona is mapped to portfolios of stocks and funds curated by our team. Users are provided their recommended portfolio along with education on how to manage it.

By simplifying the investing process through personalized recommendations, we empower people to make smarter choices about their money. InvestorSvaabhav aims to make investing accessible and understandable for everyone.
